"The Emotional Effects of Multiple Season Ending Injuries in Collegiate Athletes"

### Abstract
The purpose of my project was to examine the experiences of collegiate athletes who have experienced multiple season ending injuries.  Most collegiate athletes will experience some sort of acute or chronic injury in their athletic career, but very few will experience a season ending injury.  While the literature has examined season ending injuries, little is known about the experiences of college athletes who have multiple season ending injuries.  Being out of competition and practice for two or more seasons can have a negative psychological impact on the athletesâ€™ lives.  This study used in-depth interviews with five Division I collegiate athletes to examine their emotional responses and coping methods from experiencing multiple season ending injuries. Semi-conducted interviews were used with qualitative research practices.

Attached to the repository are the files to show the process of how the research was conducted in a Manuscript, with also the findings in a PPT.
